# Amazons

In memory of Elwyn Berlekamp (1940-2019) who introduced this game to me, I decided to make the Game of Amazons. The original game was supposed to be played on a 10x10 grid but I decided to start with 6x6 and with 2 queens on opposing sides.

Rules of the game:

Queens start on opposing edges where **Q** is player one (Black Queen in Chess terms) and **q** is player two (White Queen in Chess terms

TLDR Gameplay: Queen must move horizontally, vertically and diagonally like chess and can be adjacent to each other. Once moved, they must fire an arrow to a square in the game which gets "burned off". The queen cannot jump the burnt off square or cross it.
